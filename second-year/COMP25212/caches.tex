	What does a fully associative cache store?
}{
	Addresses and their corresponding data
}

\card{
  How does the CPU locate an item in a fully associative cache?
}{
  Hardware compares the input address with all stored addresses (in parallel)\\
  If we get a match we have a hit\\
  If no match we must go to main memory
}

\card{
  What is temporal locality?
}{
  The principle that if you use an address once, you may use it again soon e.g. loops
}

\card{What is spatial locality?}
{
  The principle that if you use an address once, you are also likely to use addresses nearby e.g. arrays
}

\card{What are the three common cache replacement algorithms?}
{
  Least Recently Used (LRU)\\
  Round Robin\\
  Random
}

\card{Explain the write-through cache write strategy.}
{
  Whenever a write is done to the cache, the write is also done to main memory
}

\card{Explain the copy-back cache write strategy.}
{
  When a cache line is replaced, if the dirty bit is set, the modified value is written to main memory
}

\card{Why does a direct mapped cache usually use static RAM?}
{
  It is a lot faster than dynamic RAM
}

\card{
  How many transistors do DRAM and SRAM use per bit?
}{
  1 and 6.
}

\card{Briefly explain what a set associative cache consists of.}
{
  A number of directly mapped caches operating in parallel
}

\card{What is the advantage of using a set associative cache?}
{
  We have more flexible cache replacement strategies as we could choose any one of the caches to replace from
}

\card{What two control bits are usually used in cache entries?}
{
  Valid bit and dirty bit
}

\card{Explain what a compulsory cache miss is?}
{
  When we first start the computer, the cache is empty, so until the cache is populated, we're going to have a lot of misses (or whenever the cache hasn't seen an address before).
}

\card{Explain what a capacity cache miss is?}
{
  Since the cache is limited in size, we can’t contain all of the pages for a program, so if an address is evicted from the cache to make more space, but is then requested after, then it will be a capacity miss.
}

\card{Explain what a conflict cache miss is?}
{
  In a direct mapped or set associative cache, there is competition between memory locations for places in the cache. If the cache was fully associative, then misses due to this wouldn’t occur.
