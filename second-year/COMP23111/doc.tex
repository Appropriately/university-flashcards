% RELATIONSHIP FLASHCARDS NEED ADDING

\card{
	Explain normalization
}{
	The process of decomposing unsatisfactory relations by creating smaller relations from them.
}

\card{
	What does the normal form indicate?
}{
	The quality level of the database schema
}

\card{
	What does 1NF mean?
}{
	This is a relation in its first normal form, where every field contains only atomic values.
}

\flashcard{
	The main technique we use to try and refine schema is \blank{decomposition}.
}

\card{
	What allows us to access one row of an SQL command at a time and iterate over the rows?
}{
	A cursor
}

\flashcard{
	Triggers are constructs that react to certain conditions. They obey an \blank{event-condition-action} model.
}

% MORE TRIGGER STUFF HERE!!!!!!

\card{
	What is a transaction?
}{
	An action or series of actions carried out by the user that read or update the contents of the database.
}

\card{
	What happens if a transaction fails?
}{
	The database is rolled back to it's most recent consistent state.
}

\card{
	What are a transactions four basic properties?
}{
	\begin{tabularx}{0.32\textwidth}{l X}
		1. & Atomicity\\
		2. & Consistency\\
		3. & Isolation\\
		4. & Durability\\
	\end{tabularx}
}

\card{
	In terms of transaction, what does atomicity mean?
}{
	A transaction must either complete all work or else it must be as if no partial work was ever done.
}

\card{
	In terms of transaction, what does consistency mean?
}{
	A transaction must transform databases from one consistent state to another.
}

\card{
	In terms of transaction, what does isolation mean?
}{
	Partial effects of incomplete transactions should not be visible to other transactions.
}

\card{
	In terms of transaction, what does durability mean?
}{
	The effects of a committed transaction are permanent and must not be lost because of later failure.
}

\card{
	What is concurrency control?
}{
	The process of managing simultaneous operations on the database without allowing them to interfere with one another.
}

\card{
	When does a `lost update problem' occur? How do you solve it?
}{
	When a user's update overwrites another user's update. Mitigated by stopping concurrent operations from reading objects/tables while another operation is writing to it.
}

\card{
	When does an uncommitted dependency problem occur? How do you solve it?
}{
	When one transaction can see the immediate results of another transaction before it has committed. Mitigate this by stopping reads from occurring on objects that haven't been committed.
}

\card{
	When does an inconsistent analysis problem occur? How do you solve it?
}{
	When a transaction $A$ reads values that transaction $B$ has updated during transaction $A$ occurs. Mitigate this by stopping one transaction from reading while another is updating and vice versa
}

\card{
	What does serializability guarantee?
}{
	Sequences of execution that will ensure consistency
}

\card{
	What is a schedule?
}{
	A set of reads and writes to the database by concurrent transactions.
}

\card{
	What is a serial schedule?
}{
	This is when reads and writes must be executed consecutively with no interleaving operations.
}

\card{
	What is a non-serial schedule?
}{
	One where any operations can be interleaved?
}

\flashcard{
	To make the database as efficient as possible we want to find as many \blank{non-serial} schedules as we can so that we can get \blank{parallel} computation.
}

\flashcard{
	The two most basic control techniques are \blank{locking} and \blank{timestamping}.
}

\card{
	What is locking?
}{
	This is when data items are locked to prevent other transactions from viewing or updating them.
}

\flashcard{
	Transactions must obtain a \blank{shared} lock on a data item when it wants to read.
}

\flashcard{
	Transactions must obtain an \blank{exclusive} lock when it wants to write.
}

\flashcard{
	Locks are assigned using the \blank{two-phase-locking} protocol.
}

\flashcard{
	The two phases in the two-phase-locking protocol are the \blank{growing} phase and the \blank{shrinking} phase.
}

\card{
	What happens in the growing phase of the two-phase-locking protocol?
}{
	The transaction my acquire locks but cannot release them.
}

\card{
	What happens in the shrinking phase of the two-phase-locking protocol?
}{
	The transaction my release locks but cannot acquire them.
}

\card{
	How can cascading rollback be prevented?
}{
	By ensuring that locks are only released at the end of transactions.
}

\card{
	What should happen if deadlock occurs?
}{
	One or more of the transactions should be aborted and restarted.
}
