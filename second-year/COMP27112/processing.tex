\card{What is Nyquist's Theorem?}{
  A periodic signal can be reconstructed if the sampling interval is half the period. \\
  An object can be detected if two samples span the smallest dimension.
}

\card{What is the \textbf{Convoluion} pseudo-code?}{
  place template on image, pixel by pixel \\
  multiply overlapping values in image and template \\
  limits are template size, ignore or pad egde cases \\
  sum products of each overlapping cell (and normalize)

% Region detection and description 

\flashcard{
  A \textbf{blob} is a set of pixels that \blank{share some property} and \blank{are connected}.
}

\card{What is \textbf{connected component analysis}?}{
  Descriptive information can be derived from blobs: moments of area, chain codes and colour distribution. Its aims are to identify groups of contiguous pixels and label separate blobs.
