\flashcard{
  In computer graphics, \blank{double buffering} is a technique for drawing graphics that shows no (or less) stutter, tearing, and other artifacts. It is difficult for a program to draw a display so that pixels do not change more than once.

\card{What are the three classes of \textbf{reflection}?}{
  Diffuse reflection \\
  Perfect specular reflection \\
  Imperfect specular reflection
}

\flashcard{
  With diffuse reflection, incident rays of light are reflected in \blank{in all directions from the surface}. \\
  A \textbf{perfect} diffuse surface reflects an incoming ray across all angles. The surface looks \blank{dull, or matte}.

\flashcard{
  The viewing transformation transforms the \blank{window} in world space to the \blank{viewport} in screen space.
}

\card{ Explain the 3 steps of the viewing transformation M }{
  M1 - translate the window to the origin \\
  M2 - Scale the window to the same size as the origin \\
  M3 - Shift to the viewport position \\
  M = M3 * M2 * M1
}

\flashcard{ The two main types of projection are \blank{parallel} and \blank{perspective} }

\card{Explain the 3 types of axonometric projection} {
  Isometric - all axis are equally foreshortened and make the same angle. \\
  Dimetric - 2 of the three axis appear equally foreshortened and make the same angle. \\
  Trimetric - All axis appear unequally foreshortened and none share the same angle. \\
  This is a bad explanation, difficult to conceptualise.
