\card{
  What does $O(<expr>)$ mean?
}{
  The complexity (i.e. running time/space) is bounded by the $<expr>$.
}

\card{
  What does $\Theta(<expr>)$ mean?
}{
  The complexity (i.e. space/running time) has the complexity proportional to
  $<expr>$.
}

\card{
  What does $\Omega(<expr>)$ mean?
}{
  The complexity (i.e. running time/space) is \textit{at least} by the $<expr>$.
}

\card{
  Say that the input represents a positive integer, $x$, what is the size of $n$?
 }{
  $\left \lfloor \log_b x \right \rfloor + 1$
  Where $b$ is the number representation, usually binary (so 2).
 }

\card{
  What does it mean by $O(1)$?
}{
  It takes a constant time, no matter the amount of data, to perform the operation.
}
