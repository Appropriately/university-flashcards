  In a tree, if node $u$ is the \textbf{parent (ancestor)} node of $v$, then $v$ is a \blank{child} (\blank{descendent}) of $u$. Two children of the same parent are \blank{siblings}.
}

\card{What is a tree?}{
  A tree $T$ is a non-empty set of nodes storing useful information in a parent-child relationship with the following properties: \\
  $T$ has a special node $r$ referred to as the root. \\ 
  Each node $v$ of $T$ different from $r$ has a parent node $u$.

\flashcard{
  In a tree, an external node is known as \blank{a leaf node}. It has no \blank{children}. 
}

\flashcard{
  In a tree, an internal node has one or more \blank{children}.

  $O(V^2)$ since finding neighbours takes $O(V)$ time.

  How do we insert an element into a heap?
}{
  First, you insert it at the next space in the heap (last element of current
  row, or a new row), then you keep swapping it with its parent if the parent
  is larger than it.
}

\card{
  How do we remove the smallest element from a (min) heap?
}{
  We move the last element from the heap to the first element (we can override
  the first element since we've removed it). Now we `down heap' by swapping
  the moved node with its smallest child until it is smaller than both its
  children or it has no children.
